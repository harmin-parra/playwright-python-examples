# playwright-python-examples

These are the [Cypress](https://example.cypress.io/) sample tests, but they have been rewritten into [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) and Python (pytest).

Be aware that some Cypress commands don't have an equivalent in Playwright, thus some workarounds are proposed.

If you find a better solution or do you have an alternative solution to one of the tests, please share it with me by raising an [issue](/issues).
